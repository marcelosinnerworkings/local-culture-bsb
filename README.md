# Local culture - Brasilia/DF, Brazil

## What is it?

The current project intends to create a basic inventory of the cultural institutions and tourtist attractions of the city of Brasilia, including the main public monuments, museums, and theaters, as well as traditional restaurants, caf√©s, and bars.

## Why?

Few Brazilian websites gather this set of information in a centralized and simple manner. The effort is to provide a single and reliable source of information for tourists.

Please note that I don't intend to exhaust all the existing institutions: I only present a tentative list, which is continuously being built and improved. 

## What is the tech stack?

The stack comprises:

* PHP
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Postgres in the cloud (ElephantSQL)
