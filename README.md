# Local culture - Brasilia/DF, Brazil

The current project intends to create a basic inventory of the cultural institutions of the city of Brasilia, including public monuments, museums, and theaters, as well as traditional restaurants, caf√©s, and bars.

I do not intend to exhaust all the existing institutions but only to present a tentative group of things to do should you decide to visit Brasilia.
